# Maine-Clean-Elections-Analysis
This repo contains two R scripts I used to visualize and sort participation in Maine's clean elections program. 

The script "Which senate candidates changed status.R" sorts through the data about all candidates' runs and keeps track of how many of their runs were publicly and privately funded. It then spits back a list of candidates who have run both publicly and privately funded elections, and therefore must have changed their strategy at some point. I used this list to pinpoint candidates to call. 

The script "MCEA particaption over time by party.R" contains some of the same code. It sorts through the list of candidates, groups them by party, and visualizes the percentage of candidates in each party that ran publicly funded campaigns each year. 

The published story that resulted from this work is [here] (http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/50-solutions/where-citizens-can-run-for-office-without-big-money-and-win-20161104).
